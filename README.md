# Lunar-Lander
This assignment will involve a game that simulates a landing craft descending to the surface of the moon (a version of this classic video game). In the game, players are in control of the descending lander. Gravity steadily accelerates their craft towards the moon's surface. Players have a single control: A button labeled "thrust" on it. Applying thrust slows their ship down. The goal is to get the lander to be moving at a slow enough speed that it doesnâ€™t crash upon impact. However, players have a limited amount of fuel, and when that runs out, players can no longer apply thrust.
